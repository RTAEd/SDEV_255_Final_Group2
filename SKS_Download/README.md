Secret Key Shield is a password management application. It requires you to login in order to store your username and passwords.

The app allows you to:

- Create a new User
  Upon entering the app, there is a button that allows the user to make an SKS account. You can make one for yourself. Be sure to remember it!
  
- Login
  One computer can have many users. This app can store username/password information of multiple people, so be sure to login to the right account. Press the 'Enter'     key to submit your entry. You only get three attempts to login. Fail to login and the app will close on you. 
  
Once you sucessfully login, you will be directed to the Welcome Screen. Here you have the option to either:
